### :bulb:**General Idea** 
When walking around an art gallary, we sometimes wonder what will an artwork look like in another style. Or how will a photograph look like under a master's paint brush. So our goal for this project is to transfer a picture using the style of another picture through what we learned in CIS545 last semester, machine learning :raised_hands:

*  :iphone: Front end: 
   * Out website will beign with a simple demo instruction. After reviewing the instruction, user will continue to the application
   * User will update load two images of their choice, one for content and one for style, to produce the final integrated image
   * We will beautify our website using HTML and CSS
*  :floppy_disk: Back end: 
   * We will use Tensorflow's interpreter to process the image through Python
   * Start with the simple combination and we will add more custmization tuning features like blending % if we have time
*  :computer: Webapp deployment:
   * We will use Heroku to deploy our web app
